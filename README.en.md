# os-fix-skill

[中文](README.md)

This repository is a structured knowledge base for KylinOS Desktop V11. It records reusable workflows for desktop-system repair and feature enhancement. It is not an executable program and is not tied to one AI tool's built-in skill directory. Humans can browse the directories directly, and multiple AI tools can start from `$HOME/.os-fix-skill/SKILL.md` and progressively load only the relevant references.

It currently covers UKUI, KARE/Kaiming, Clash Verge TUN, application installation, aTrust/UEM security clients, autostart, global search, system tray behavior, input methods, system services, maintenance mode, the PanShi architecture, fingerprint and graphics hardware, storage layout, local source customizations, and AI-tool configuration.

## Install an AI Coding Tool First

If you do not already have an AI coding tool, install one of Codex, Claude Code, or opencode first. The commands below target Linux/macOS terminals. For other systems or installation methods, use the linked official docs.

### Codex

Official docs:

- Codex CLI: https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli
- Codex quickstart: https://developers.openai.com/codex/quickstart

Recommended install command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
```

Start it with:

```bash
codex
```

### Claude Code

Official docs:

- Claude Code quickstart: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart
- Claude Code setup: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup

Recommended install command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Start it with:

```bash
claude
```

### opencode

Official docs:

- opencode docs: https://opencode.ai/docs/
- opencode download: https://opencode.ai/download

Recommended install command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

Start it with:

```bash
opencode
```

If your system policy does not allow `curl | sh` or `curl | bash`, open the official pages above and choose a standalone package, Homebrew, npm, or another trusted installation method for your system.

## Install This Knowledge Base

### Option 1: Ask an AI Tool to Install It

Send this prompt to Codex, Claude Code, opencode, or a similar tool:

```text
Please install this KylinOS Desktop V11 system knowledge base:

https://github.com/Swordup-Z/kylinos-desktop-v11-skill

Requirements:
1. Clone it to $HOME/.os-fix-skill.
2. Configure the user-level global prompt for the current tool, for example:
   - Codex: $HOME/.codex/AGENTS.md
   - Claude Code: $HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md
   - opencode: $HOME/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md
3. When the user works on KylinOS Desktop V11, UKUI, KARE/Kaiming, Clash Verge, TUN, maintenance mode, the PanShi architecture, system services, partitions, mounts, or desktop AI subsystem issues, first read $HOME/.os-fix-skill/SKILL.md, then follow its references routing.
4. After installation, tell me the entry file path and how to use it later.
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

```bash
cd "$HOME"
git clone https://github.com/Swordup-Z/kylinos-desktop-v11-skill.git "$HOME/.os-fix-skill"
```

Entry file:

```text
$HOME/.os-fix-skill/SKILL.md
```

Common user-level prompt files:

```text
Codex:       $HOME/.codex/AGENTS.md
Claude Code: $HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md
opencode:    $HOME/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md
```

Use a fixed session name for system maintenance, such as `os-fix`:

```bash
codex resume os-fix
claude resume os-fix
opencode resume os-fix
```

## Architecture

The skill is split into two top-level task types:

- **System Repair**: existing system behavior is broken, failing, noisy, or not persistent. Examples include TUN failures, autostart not working, system-tray hidden state not persisting, disconnected fingerprint devices, and service failures.
- **Feature Enhancement**: the system works, but the user wants new capabilities, changed defaults, or local customization. Examples include adding Bing/Google to UKUI global search, adding a custom command panel, preserving local source patches, or configuring AI-tool global prompts.

Both task types use the same scenario categories:

```text
system
applications
ukui
network
hardware
storage
agent-tools
source-rebuild
```

```

`references/` is the scenario routing layer. Each reference contains scope, a short explanation, a knowledge entry, and minimal diagnostics. `knowledge/<type>/<scenario>/README.md` is the scenario index that routes to one concrete chapter. The concrete `<topic>.md` files contain background, diagnosis, repair or enhancement steps, verification, rollback, and cleanup notes. Reusable source-level features also keep patch sets and `PATCHSET.md` metadata under the same scenario's `patches/<feature-id>/` directory.

Fixed loading path:

```text
task type
-> scenario reference
-> scenario knowledge README
-> concrete knowledge chapter
```

## Routing Examples

Clash Verge TUN failure:

```text
SKILL.md
-> references/system-repair/network.md
-> knowledge/system-repair/network/README.md
-> knowledge/system-repair/network/proxy-tun.md
```

UKUI global search showing uninstalled Software Center apps:

```text
SKILL.md
-> references/system-repair/ukui.md
-> knowledge/system-repair/ukui/README.md
-> knowledge/system-repair/ukui/search.md
```

Adding a custom command panel to UKUI global search:

```text
SKILL.md
-> references/feature-enhancement/ukui.md
-> knowledge/feature-enhancement/ukui/README.md
-> knowledge/feature-enhancement/ukui/search-command-provider.md
```

Configuring Codex, Claude Code, or opencode to load this knowledge base:

```text
SKILL.md
-> references/feature-enhancement/agent-tools.md
-> knowledge/feature-enhancement/agent-tools/README.md
-> knowledge/feature-enhancement/agent-tools/global-prompts.md
```

## Coverage

### System Repair

- Maintenance mode, the PanShi architecture, and system-level modification boundaries.
- Application installation, AppImage, third-party apt sources, KARE/Kaiming isolation, and aTrust/UEM security-client components.
- Clash Verge TUN, `/dev/net/tun`, proxy services, and proxy core paths.
- UKUI autostart, global-search issues, shortcuts, system tray, input methods, panel/taskbar behavior, and open-with file-dialog behavior.
- Desktop AI components, AI subsystem cleanup, and residues.
- Fingerprint/biometric authentication, graphics frequency, and hardware stability.
- Root partition, DATA partition, `/home` mount location, overlay views, Kaiming/KARE, and ostree disk-usage analysis.

### Feature Enhancement

- UKUI global-search search-engine customization.
- UKUI global-search custom command provider and graphical command configuration.
- UKUI system-tray input-method status badges and similar desktop interaction enhancements.
- Local source customization workspaces, commits, patches, and build-artifact cleanup.
- Reusable source patch sets, upstream repositories, base nodes, and conflict migration rules.
- AI-tool global prompts, permission configuration, and multi-tool loading rules.
- DATA partition layout for local source and build work.

## Safety Boundary

System-level changes on KylinOS Desktop V11 often require maintenance mode. Before touching `/usr`, `/etc`, `/opt`, system packages, systemd units, device nodes, partitions, KSaf, or system services, check:

```bash
mm-cli -s
```

Enter maintenance mode:

```bash
sudo mm-cli -o
```

Exit and save:

```bash
sudo mm-cli -c -a
```

Switching maintenance mode usually requires a reboot. Detailed operational rules live in `SKILL.md` and the relevant reference/knowledge chapters.

## Companion Tools

Space cleanup, Kaiming/KARE layer control, and ostree usage auditing should live in a companion application instead of large embedded scripts or project-specific development requirements inside knowledge files. If a local development workspace exists, read the project-level prompt first:

```text
$HOME/desktop-develop/kylin-space-guard/AGENTS.md
```

This skill keeps only system diagnostics, safety boundaries, and reusable repair knowledge. Concrete UI, build, verification, dependency, and implementation rules belong in the independent project. Tool projects must still follow this skill's system safety boundary: do not automatically delete ostree deployments, EFI files, GRUB config, loader entries, `/etc/fstab`, or partition tables.
