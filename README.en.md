# kylinos-v11-desktop-fix-skill

[中文](README.md)

This repository is a structured repair knowledge base for KylinOS Desktop V11. It records reusable workflows for existing desktop-system behavior that is broken, failing, noisy, not persistent, or caused by damaged system services. It is not an executable program and is not tied to one tool's built-in directory. The entry file is `$HOME/.os-fix-skill/SKILL.md`; detailed content is organized under `references/` and `knowledge/`.

It covers UKUI, KARE/Kaiming, Clash Verge TUN, application installation, aTrust/UEM security clients, autostart, global search, system tray behavior, screen-lock timeout, input methods, system services, maintenance mode, the PanShi architecture, fingerprint and graphics hardware, storage layout, and desktop AI subsystem cleanup.

Feature enhancement, local customization, default-behavior changes, and source-level feature additions are maintained in the companion enhancement knowledge base.

## Install This Knowledge Base

```bash
cd "$HOME"
git clone https://github.com/Swordup-Z/kylinos-v11-desktop-fix-skill.git "$HOME/.os-fix-skill"
```

### Install by Pasting a Prompt into an AI Tool

You can also paste the following prompt into Codex, Claude Code, or opencode and let the AI tool install and connect this knowledge base for you:

```text
Please install the KylinOS Desktop V11 repair knowledge base kylinos-v11-desktop-fix-skill on this machine and connect it to the current AI tool's user-level rule file.

Requirements:
1. Check that git is available first.
2. If $HOME/.os-fix-skill does not exist, run:
   git clone https://github.com/Swordup-Z/kylinos-v11-desktop-fix-skill.git "$HOME/.os-fix-skill"
3. If $HOME/.os-fix-skill already exists and is a git repository, only use non-destructive updates:
   git -C "$HOME/.os-fix-skill" status -sb
   git -C "$HOME/.os-fix-skill" fetch --prune
   git -C "$HOME/.os-fix-skill" pull --ff-only
   If there are local changes, branch divergence, or a fast-forward failure, do not overwrite anything; report the reason instead.
4. If $HOME/.os-fix-skill already exists but is not a git repository, do not delete or overwrite it; stop and explain why.
5. Confirm that $HOME/.os-fix-skill/SKILL.md exists.
6. Create the parent directory for the current AI tool's user-level rule file if needed.
7. Append the rules below to the current AI tool's user-level rule file. If you cannot identify the current tool, ask me first. Do not overwrite existing content, and do not append duplicate rules if equivalent rules already exist.

Rule file locations:
- Codex: $HOME/.codex/AGENTS.md
- Claude Code: $HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- opencode: $HOME/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md

Rules to append:
When the user is working on KylinOS Desktop V11, UKUI, KARE, Kaiming, Clash Verge, system services, autostart, TUN, maintenance mode, the PanShi architecture, system protection, partitions, mounts, overlay, desktop AI subsystem, or related desktop operating-system issues, and the symptom is an existing capability that is broken, failing, noisy, not persistent, failing to install, or caused by damaged system services, use $HOME/.os-fix-skill/SKILL.md as the default knowledge entry. Before handling a system repair issue, read $HOME/.os-fix-skill/SKILL.md, then follow its reference routing and selectively read references/<scenario>.md. Then read only the referenced knowledge/<scenario>/README.md and one concrete knowledge chapter that matches the current symptom. If no concrete reference or knowledge chapter matches, do not traverse the whole skill. Only read $HOME/.os-fix-skill/references/system.md when the issue is clearly about maintenance mode, system protection, systemd/D-Bus base services, or system health-check noise. Follow "diagnose first, modify second, verify last". Before any system-level repair involving /usr, /etc, /opt, system packages, system services, device nodes, partitions, KSaf policies, or similar system paths, run mm-cli -s to check maintenance mode; only modify system paths, system services, or system packages after confirming the machine is in maintain mode.

When finished, tell me the repository path, the rule file path you updated, and whether any update was skipped because of local changes or branch state.
```

Entry file:

```text
$HOME/.os-fix-skill/SKILL.md
```

Common user-level rule files:

```text
Codex:       $HOME/.codex/AGENTS.md
Claude Code: $HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md
opencode:    $HOME/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md
```

After these rule files are connected to this knowledge base, KylinOS Desktop V11 repair issues can start from `$HOME/.os-fix-skill/SKILL.md` and then follow `references/`. Feature enhancement, local customization, and default-behavior changes are maintained in `$HOME/.os-enhance-skill`.

Use a fixed session name for system maintenance, such as `os-fix`:

```bash
codex resume os-fix
claude resume os-fix
opencode resume os-fix
```

## Architecture

This repository focuses on system repair workflows: existing system behavior is broken, failing, noisy, or not persistent. Examples include TUN failures, autostart not working, system-tray hidden state not persisting, disconnected fingerprint devices, and service failures.

Repair content is grouped by scenario:

```text
system
applications
ukui
network
hardware
storage
agent-tools
source-rebuild
```

```

`references/` is the scenario routing layer. Each reference contains scope, a short explanation, a knowledge entry, and minimal diagnostics. `knowledge/<scenario>/README.md` is the scenario index that routes to one concrete chapter. The concrete `<topic>.md` files contain background, diagnosis, repair steps, verification, rollback, and cleanup notes. Reusable source-level repairs also keep patch sets and `PATCHSET.md` metadata under the same scenario's `patches/<fix-id>/` directory.

Fixed loading path:

```text
repair request
-> scenario reference
-> scenario knowledge README
-> concrete knowledge chapter
```

## Routing Examples

Clash Verge TUN failure:

```text
SKILL.md
-> references/network.md
-> knowledge/network/README.md
-> knowledge/network/tun-device.md or knowledge/network/clash-verge-service.md
```

UKUI global search showing uninstalled Software Center apps:

```text
SKILL.md
-> references/ukui.md
-> knowledge/ukui/README.md
-> knowledge/ukui/search.md
```

For tasks such as adding a custom command panel to UKUI global search or connecting shared knowledge bases, use `$HOME/.os-enhance-skill/SKILL.md`.

## Coverage

- Maintenance mode, the PanShi architecture, and system-level modification boundaries.
- Application installation, AppImage, third-party apt sources, KARE/Kaiming isolation, and aTrust/UEM security-client components.
- Clash Verge TUN, `/dev/net/tun`, proxy services, and proxy core paths.
- UKUI autostart, global-search issues, shortcuts, system tray, screen-lock timeout, input methods, panel/taskbar behavior, and open-with file-dialog behavior.
- Desktop AI components, AI subsystem cleanup, and residues.
- Fingerprint/biometric authentication, graphics frequency, and hardware stability.
- Root partition, DATA partition, `/home` mount location, overlay views, Kaiming/KARE, and ostree disk-usage analysis.

## Safety Boundary

System-level changes on KylinOS Desktop V11 often require maintenance mode. Before touching `/usr`, `/etc`, `/opt`, system packages, systemd units, device nodes, partitions, KSaf, or system services, check:

```bash
mm-cli -s
```

Enter maintenance mode:

```bash
sudo mm-cli -o
```

Exit and save:

```bash
sudo mm-cli -c -a
```

Switching maintenance mode usually requires a reboot. Detailed operational rules live in `SKILL.md` and the relevant reference/knowledge chapters.

## Companion Tools

Space cleanup, Kaiming/KARE layer control, and ostree usage auditing are better handled by companion applications. If a local development workspace exists, start from the corresponding project rules:

```text
$HOME/desktop-develop/kylin-space-guard/AGENTS.md
```

This repository records system diagnostics, safety boundaries, and reusable repair knowledge. Concrete UI, build, verification, dependency, and implementation rules belong in the independent project. Tool projects must still follow the system safety boundary: do not automatically delete ostree deployments, EFI files, GRUB config, loader entries, `/etc/fstab`, or partition tables.

On this machine, the usual development workspace entry is:

```text
$HOME/desktop-develop/AGENTS.md
```

That file only routes requests to projects; each concrete project continues from its own `AGENTS.md`.
